# Gen-your-pass
The objective was to us JS to create a random password generator and  have user confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters and generate a random password based on that input. I was able to fufill the objective by using functions, if statement, for loops, and window prompts.
